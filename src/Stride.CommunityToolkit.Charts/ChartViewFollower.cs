/// <summary>
/// Keeps a chart's ranges in step with what an orthographic camera sees, turning it into a Desmos-style
/// infinite chart: pan and the axes follow, zoom out and the grid still covers the whole screen with a
/// coarser tick step, zoom in and it refines. Owned by the chart while
/// <see cref="ChartRangeOptions.FollowCamera"/> is on and pumped by <see cref="Chart.Update(CameraComponent)"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The follower only reads the camera - position and orthographic size - and never writes to it, so it
/// works with <c>Basic2DCameraController</c>, any other controller, or a camera animated by hand. On each
/// meaningful view change it picks a 1-2-5 tick step for the zoom level (<see cref="ChartFraming.NiceTickStep"/>)
/// and writes the new range into the chart's options, which the chart's own range diff then applies.
/// Changes smaller than half a percent of the view are ignored, so an idle camera costs nothing.
