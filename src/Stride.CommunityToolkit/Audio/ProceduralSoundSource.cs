/// pipeline: its constructor is internal and its data is compressed at build time. The one public

/// <see cref="DynamicSoundSource"/>, and this class is that source: the engine asks it for a block
/// of samples whenever a device buffer is free, and it asks the callback.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Buffering: four buffers of <see cref="FramesPerBuffer"/> frames each, the same shape as the
/// engine's own streaming source. At 44.1 kHz one buffer is about 93 ms, so a change the callback
/// picks up on its next call is heard within roughly a tenth of a second.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The source and the instance reference each other and neither constructor can run first; the
/// engine's own <c>CompressedSoundSource</c> solves this by passing <see langword="null"/> to the
/// base constructor, assigning the protected <c>soundInstance</c> field afterwards, and adding
/// itself to the worker's queue last. <see cref="Create"/> does the same. One trap: the
/// <see cref="SoundInstance"/> constructor resets the instance's looping flag, which reaches
/// <see cref="SetLooped"/> before the field is assigned - so that override must not touch the
