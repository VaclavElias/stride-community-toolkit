/// The engine's <c>AudioEmitterComponent</c> does this for asset-based <c>Sound</c>s only. A
/// runtime instance - from <see cref="AudioSystemExtensions.CreateProceduralSound"/> or
/// <see cref="WavSound.CreateInstance"/> with <c>spatialized: true</c> - is positioned by calling
/// <see cref="SoundInstance.Apply3D"/> with an <see cref="AudioEmitter"/>, and this script does
/// that with the entity's world transform: position, forward and up from the matrix, velocity as
/// the position change since the previous frame. That last one matches how the engine's listener
/// processor estimates velocity, so Doppler sees both sides the same way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Spatialisation is relative to the listener the instance was created with. By default that is the
/// engine's default listener, which never moves; pass the result of
/// <see cref="AudioSystemExtensions.AttachListener"/> when creating the instance for a listener that
/// follows the camera.

/// var listener = game.Audio.AttachListener(game.GetCameraEntity());
/// var instance = chime.CreateInstance(spatialized: true, listener: listener);

/// entity.Add(new SoundEmitterScript { Instance = instance });
