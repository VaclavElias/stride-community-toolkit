/// Ending a one-shot is the delicate part, and this class does it differently from the engine's
/// own streaming source. That one stops itself the moment it queues the last buffer, which does two
/// things wrong here: it resets the prebuffer state before the voice may have started (a sound
/// short enough to fit in one buffer then never plays), and it leaves the instance reporting
/// <c>Playing</c> for ever, because on XAudio2 the native "playing" flag is never cleared for a
/// streamed source that ends on its own. So after the last buffer is queued this source waits,
/// from <see cref="UpdateInternal"/> on the worker thread, until the device has handed every buffer
/// back - which is exactly when the last sample has played - and only then stops, explicitly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Three buffers rather than the engine's four: the worker wants a third of them filled before it
/// starts the voice, so three means one buffer is enough, and a sound that fits in a single
/// buffer starts like any other.
