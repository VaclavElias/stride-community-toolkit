/// <para>
/// Box2D v3 has no mouse joint, so this uses the idiom of Box2D's own sample browser: a kinematic
/// anchor body is created at the grab point and a motor joint ties the picked body to it; every
/// frame the anchor is moved to the cursor with a target transform, so it carries a velocity the
/// joint feels; on release both are destroyed. The body is never moved directly, so it keeps
/// colliding and pushing while held.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Tuning follows the samples: a 7.5 Hz spring with critical damping, a force cap of
/// <see cref="ForceScale"/> times the body's weight so heavy and light bodies drag alike, and an
/// angular friction torque scaled by the body's lever arm so it does not spin freely on the end of
/// the cursor. The grab ends by itself if the body is destroyed under the cursor.
