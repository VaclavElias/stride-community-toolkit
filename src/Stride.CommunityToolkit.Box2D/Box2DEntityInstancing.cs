/// <summary>
/// An <see cref="EntityInstancing"/> for Box2D bodies that stops working entirely once the
/// bodies fall asleep, mirroring <c>BepuEntityInstancing</c> from Stride.CommunityToolkit.Bepu.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Box2D puts bodies to sleep when they come to rest, and a sleeping body's transform cannot change.
/// That makes re-reading every transform, re-inverting every matrix and re-computing the bounding box
/// pure waste, which is what the engine does forever once a pile settles. This class checks the
/// bodies instead and reuses the previous frame's results while they are all asleep.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The check is a scan over the registered bodies, so it costs a little while things are moving - it
/// gives up at the first awake body - and pays for itself many times over when they are not. Instances
/// registered without a <see cref="Box2DBodyComponent"/> disable skipping altogether, since nothing
/// indicates when they move; a component whose body id is invalid (not yet created, or destroyed)
/// counts as asleep, because its transform cannot change either.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// game.AddInstancingSupport();
///
/// var instancing = new Box2DEntityInstancing();
/// var master = new Entity("Master") { new ModelComponent(model), new InstancingComponent { Type = instancing } };
/// master.Scene = scene;
///
/// // Instances carry a Box2DBodyComponent but no ModelComponent - the master draws them
/// foreach (var body in bodies) instancing.AddInstance(body);
