/// Two habits worth copying are in here. The first is <em>round-robin</em>: a clear picks from three
/// recordings of the same sound in turn, because one clip repeated quickly stops sounding like an
/// event and starts sounding like a machine gun. The second is <em>pitch variation</em>, which does
/// the same job along a different axis and doubles here as information - a bigger clear is a lower,
/// heavier sound, so the size of what just happened is audible before the number is readable.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Round-robin is doing more work than it looks like here. A <see cref="SoundInstance"/> plays one
/// sound at a time, so replaying one that is still sounding necessarily cuts it off - which is what
/// the previous version did with its single instance, meaning the faster the player went the less
/// they heard. Three instances means three clears can overlap; only the fourth in quick succession
/// interrupts anything.
