/// Builds a rope as a chain of small dynamic bodies tied together with distance limits.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// There is no rope type in Bepu, and the obvious construction - rigid ball sockets between
/// segments - is the one that misbehaves. The approach here follows Bepu's own RopeStabilityDemo:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Link with a <see cref="DistanceLimitConstraintComponent"/> rather than a ball socket, with
/// a minimum of a tenth of the maximum. A rope should be free to go slack; only stretching is
/// forbidden.</item>
/// <item>Anchor those constraints at the segment centres when stability matters. A zero lever arm
/// means a segment's own rotation cannot feed back into the chain.</item>
/// <item>Add skip constraints. Tying a segment to several ahead of it lets an impulse travel along
/// shortcuts instead of crawling down the chain one link at a time.</item>
/// </list>
