/// This exists because Bepu offers no per-body gravity scale: <see cref="BodyComponent.Gravity"/> is
/// only on or off, and the simulation's damping is global, so slowing one body down that way would
/// slow every cube with it. The workable per-body lever is the same one
/// <see cref="SlidingCubeComponent"/> uses: adjust the velocity in

/// <para>
/// Each tick the integrator adds one tick of full gravity; this component immediately removes
/// (1 - <see cref="GravityScale"/>) of it again, so the net acceleration is gravity scaled. Cancelling
/// acceleration rather than clamping speed keeps the motion natural - the letters still accelerate,
/// bounce and tumble, just as if they were falling on a smaller planet.
