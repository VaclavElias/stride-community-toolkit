/// The obvious alternative - ask each cube where it is and compare positions - is what this example
/// used to do, and it was quietly wrong. Comparing floats needs a tolerance, and cubes are *moving*:
/// while a stack is collapsing they sit between slots, so a click during the fall found some
/// neighbours and missed others. The player saw a group of eight and was paid for five. Snapping to
/// integers does not fix that on its own either, because a cube halfway between two slots rounds to
/// whichever it is nearer, which changes from frame to frame.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Holding the layout separately removes the question. A clear updates the grid immediately, so the
/// very next click matches against the finished layout even while the cubes are still visibly falling
/// into it. The raycast still returns whatever the player actually hit, so what they click and what
/// they score never disagree.
