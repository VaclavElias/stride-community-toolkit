    A main menu built from code whose buttons grow a blue underline while the pointer is over them.
    Two things make a hover effect work in Stride's UI, and both are easy to miss. A Button reports
    nothing in MouseOverState until RequiresMouseOverUpdate is set on it, which is off by default
    because tracking it costs a hit test per element per frame - forgetting it is the usual reason a
    hand-written hover effect does nothing at all. And the animation is a lerp toward a target width
    rather than a fixed step per frame, so it settles in the same time whatever the frame rate and
    reverses smoothly when the pointer leaves mid-animation.
concepts:
  - "Reacting to the pointer with RequiresMouseOverUpdate and MouseOverState"
  - Animating a UI element from a SyncScript
  - Frame-rate independent movement with a clamped lerp
  - Laying an underline out inside the button so nothing resizes
  - Driving many UI elements from a single script
  - "Using helpers: SetupBase3D, AddSkybox"
