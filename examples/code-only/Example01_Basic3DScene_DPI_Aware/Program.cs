    The capsule scene again, with two differences. One is not in the C# at all: an app.manifest declaring
    the process per-monitor DPI aware, referenced from the csproj. Without it Windows scales the window
    itself on a high-DPI display and the result is a blurred, upscaled image. The other is what a sharp
    window then needs: with Windows no longer enlarging anything, 16-pixel text on a 150% display is two
    thirds the height it should be, so DisplayScale reads the display's factor and the overlay follows
    it - the help text is the same size to the eye on any monitor. The example exists because the first
    fix is invisible in the source, so it is easy to conclude that Stride renders badly when the real
    cause is a missing manifest.
