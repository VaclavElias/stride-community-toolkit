/// One exhibit: its words, and the two methods that make it - one run once when the ring is
/// built, one run every frame. Both receive the station, so a method draws or places things in
/// station coordinates and never learns where on the ring it stands, which is what lets it be
/// lifted into any game with a station at the origin. The order of a registry is the order of the
/// gallery; inserting one shifts every number after it.
