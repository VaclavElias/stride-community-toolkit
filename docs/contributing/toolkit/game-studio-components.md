# Making components work in Game Studio

A toolkit library that ships `EntityComponent` types has to satisfy four separate requirements
before those components are usable from Game Studio. Each one is easy to miss, none of them produces
an error naming the cause, and they fail at four different moments - so it is worth knowing them all
before you start rather than discovering them one at a time.

| Missing | What the user sees |
|---|---|
| `Module.cs` | The component never appears in the Add-component list at all |
| `[DataContract]` | It appears, then throws `No serializer available for type ...` when added |
| A processor that provisions its own renderer | It adds and configures cleanly, and draws nothing until the game runs |
| Editor-safe camera and font lookups | The viewport draws nothing, and the Output pane shows an exception from the renderer |

Everything below works in code-only projects without any of it, which is exactly why these gaps
survive: the library looks finished, its examples run, and the editor path is never exercised.
`ShapeComponent`, `WorldTextComponent` and `EntityTextComponent` went through all four in one day
(2026-09-07), and each section names where they ended up, so there is working code to copy.

## 1. Register the assembly for scanning

Game Studio only inspects assemblies that have registered themselves. Without this file the
component types are invisible to the editor - not greyed out, not erroring, simply absent.

Add a `Module.cs` at the root of the library:

```csharp
using Stride.Core;
using Stride.Core.Reflection;
using System.Reflection;

namespace Stride.CommunityToolkit.YourLibrary;

internal static class Module
{
    [ModuleInitializer]
    internal static void Initialize()
    {
        AssemblyRegistry.Register(typeof(Module).GetTypeInfo().Assembly, AssemblyCommonCategories.Assets);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `ModuleInitializer` here is **`Stride.Core.ModuleInitializerAttribute`**, not the C#
> `System.Runtime.CompilerServices` attribute of the same name. The `using Stride.Core;` matters.

`Stride.CommunityToolkit`, `DebugShapes`, `ImGui`, `Shapes`, `Bepu` and `Box2D` all carry an identical
copy of this file. Scripts count too: `GrabberScript` had its attributes for months and never showed
in the editor, because the Bepu package had no `Module.cs`.

## 2. Make the component serializable, and editable

The editor clones a component from the asset side to the game side through a generated
`DataSerializer`, and Stride's assembly processor only generates one for types marked
`[DataContract]`. Without it, adding the component throws immediately.

Follow the shape the engine's own components use:

```csharp
[DefaultEntityComponentProcessor(typeof(ShapeProcessor), ExecutionMode = ExecutionMode.All)]
[DataContract("ShapeComponent")]
[Display("Shape", Expand = ExpandRule.Once)]
[ComponentCategory("Rendering")]
public sealed class ShapeComponent : ActivableEntityComponent
```

`DataContract`, `Display`, `ExpandRule` and `DataMemberIgnore` live in `Stride.Core`;
`ComponentCategory` lives in `Stride.Engine`. Category names are free-form strings - the engine uses
*Lights*, *Model*, *Physics*, *Scripts*, *Sprites*, *UI* and friends, and anything else you write
becomes a new group in the list.

`ExecutionMode.All` is the default and the right value: the scene editor is a running game, and the
processor is what draws the component there (section 3). Say `Runtime` only for a processor that
truly cannot work in the editor.

### Audit every public property before you add it

`[DataContract]` turns the whole public surface into editor-authorable state, and the property grid
has rules of its own:

- **A live runtime handle** has to be excluded, or the editor tries to serialize something
  meaningless:

  ```csharp
  /// <summary>The batch this shape draws through, or null for the game's default.</summary>
  [DataMemberIgnore]
  public ShapeBatch? Batch { get; set; }
  ```

- **Collections are `List<T>`, never arrays.** The grid shows an array read-only, and the asset
  serializer loads an array only into an instance of exactly the saved size - a property that
  defaults to an empty array can never load anything. `ShapeComponent.Vertices` is the worked example.
- **No nullable value types.** The grid cannot edit a `float?`. Express "not set" with a sentinel the
  value cannot legitimately take, the way `ShapeComponent.Inherit` uses a negative width, or with 0
  where 0 means off, the way the text components' `MaxDistance` does.
- **A read-only hint property does not work.** `ObjectDescriptor` forces `DataMemberMode.Never` for a
  getter-only `string` or value type, even with an explicit `[DataMember]`, and Stride has no
  description or tooltip attribute. The display name is the only guaranteed-visible text.

## 3. The processor provisions what draws it

A component is data; something else draws it - a scene renderer, or a render feature with a render
object. In a code-only game the setup code registers that with an `Add*` call. Game Studio never
runs a game's setup code, so the processor has to do it, and it has to do it right:

- **On the owning scene system's compositor.** Not on whatever the render context carries: in the
  editor that is the gizmo compositor's render system, and a renderer registered there draws in
  nothing. `SceneRendererRegistration` in `Rendering.Compositing` finds the compositor of the scene
  system whose scene instance is the processor's entity manager.
- **Again whenever the compositor changes.** The editor starts on a fallback compositor and swaps in
  the project's asset, and swaps again on every change of the viewport's view mode. Check per frame
  against the compositor you last registered on; it is one reference comparison.
- **Only when there is something to draw**, so an empty scene gets no renderer.
- **In `Draw`, not `OnSystemAdd`.** The processor's `Draw` runs before the compositor each frame, so
  the first frame's compositor is known there, and a swap is seen the frame it happens.

For a scene renderer that is one call in the processor's `Draw`:

```csharp
SceneRendererRegistration.Ensure(Services, EntityManager, ref _ensuredOn, () => new WorldTextRenderer());
```

`ShapeProcessor` does the same steps by hand, because it registers a `RootRenderFeature` and a
`ShapeBatch` render object into the visibility group rather than a scene renderer. Keep the game's
manual call: it still gives a code-only user the handle, the ordering and the policy choices the
automatic path decides for them, and a processor should prefer a batch or renderer the game
registered over one of its own.

## 4. Cameras and fonts the editor way

Two things a renderer takes for granted in a game are not there in the editor:

- **The camera is not in a slot.** A game's compositor names its camera in slot zero; the editor
  clears the slots and hands its own camera to the top-level camera renderer as an external camera.
  `CompositorCameras.Find(context)` in `Rendering.Compositing` tries the slot and then walks the
  renderer tree, and is what every toolkit renderer outside the camera renderer uses.
- **The built-in font is not in the content database.** The editor's database holds the project's
  built assets, and its not-found path throws `NotImplementedException` rather than returning. Ask
  `Content.Exists` first and fall back to a system font: `RendererDefaults.LoadDefaultFont` in
  `Rendering.Text` does exactly that and is what the text renderers call.

Two limits remain, and belong in the user docs rather than in code: clicking a component's drawing
in the viewport does not select its entity, because Stride's picking pass renders entity ids for
models only; and the editor draws with a system font where a game draws with Stride's.

## Checklist

- [ ] `Module.cs` registers the assembly with `AssemblyRegistry`
- [ ] Every `EntityComponent` has `[DataContract]`, `[Display]` and `[ComponentCategory]`
- [ ] Runtime-only handles on those components are `[DataMemberIgnore]`
- [ ] Collections are `List<T>`; no nullable value types; no read-only hint properties
- [ ] The processor runs in the editor and provisions its renderer on the owning compositor, re-checked per frame
- [ ] Renderers resolve the camera through `CompositorCameras` and fonts through `RendererDefaults.LoadDefaultFont`
- [ ] Verified in Game Studio's viewport, in both view modes, against a package built with
      [`build/pack-local.cs`](building.md#building-local-nuget-packages) - a `ProjectReference` does not
      exercise any of this
